# ChestX-Transcribe: Automated Medical Report Generation from Medical Images

## Overview
ChestX-Transcribe is a multimodal transformer-based project designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical images, specifically chest X-rays. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, this tool enhances the efficiency of diagnostics and provides reliable textual descriptions to assist healthcare professionals.

## Key Features
- **Automated Report Generation**: Transforms chest X-ray images into coherent and contextually relevant medical reports.
- **Multimodal Architecture**: Combines a Swin Transformer for high-resolution feature extraction with DistilGPT for generating accurate textual outputs.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Uses ngrok to facilitate secure, shareable links for remote access and demonstration.
